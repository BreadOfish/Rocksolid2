# Rocksolid 2 (Alpha 0.10)

Rocksolid 2.0 is a completely recoded version of the original 1.19.2 mod made by Breadofish. Rocksolid 2.0 will act as an expanded version of the original, adding new blocks and cut content, and providing much-needed rebalancing and texture redesigns. 

## Why rework the entire mod? Why not just update the original mod?

The simple answer: It would've required a recode anyways.

Long answer: Forge changed a lot going from 1.19.2 to 1.20.4. Like creative menus, for example. Porting it would require overhauling the entire mod, so I opted to just remake the entire thing instead. 

## Features:

### Currently implemented:
- Diamond Ore variants for different stones*
- All the glass varients*

*= Crafting recipes and loot tables aren't implemented.

### TODO:
- Add Enderite Tools.
- Add Enderite armor.
- Make the glass textures transpanrent.
- More.
